**Description**


The Generative AI Content Revisit Tool is an application designed to boost productivity in the digital realm. In the fast-paced digital world, users often come across various content - articles, videos, etc., that they wish to revisit at a later time. However, due to the constant influx of new information, these saved items are often forgotten, leading to missed opportunities and lost knowledge.

Our tool addresses this problem by enabling users to revisit a variety of digital content, including articles and videos, for later consumption. Its unique feature is the ability to remind users to revisit their saved content after a user-defined period, ensuring no critical information is missed.
